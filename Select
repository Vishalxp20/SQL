📘 SQL SELECT Queries — Complete Guide

This document explains the SQL SELECT statement and all related operations used to query, filter, and manipulate data in databases. It provides examples and explanations that are simple and human-readable for beginners and learners.

🧩 What is a SELECT Query?

The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database.
It allows you to choose which columns you want to display and from which table.

Basic Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

Example:
SELECT name, age FROM students;


✅ This retrieves the name and age columns from the students table.

🎯 Common SELECT Query Operations
1. SELECT DISTINCT

Removes duplicate records and returns only unique values.

SELECT DISTINCT city FROM customers;


✅ Returns a list of unique cities.

2. WHERE Clause

Used to filter records based on a condition.

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000;


✅ Returns employees who earn more than 50,000.

3. AND / OR Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions.

SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE country = 'India' AND city = 'Delhi';


✅ Customers from India and specifically from Delhi.

4. ORDER BY

Sorts the result in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

SELECT name, marks
FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC;


✅ Lists students sorted by marks from highest to lowest.

5. LIMIT / TOP

Limits the number of records in the output.

SELECT * FROM products
LIMIT 5;


✅ Displays only the first 5 rows.

6. IN / NOT IN

Used to check if a value matches any value in a list.

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('HR', 'Sales');


✅ Employees from HR or Sales departments.

7. BETWEEN

Filters data within a range (inclusive).

SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE price BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000;


✅ Orders with price between 1000 and 5000.

8. LIKE and Wildcards

Used for pattern matching.

Symbol	Meaning	Example	Matches
%	any number of characters	'A%'	“A”, “Apple”, “Amazon”
_	one character	'A_'	“An”, “At”
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE name LIKE 'S%';


✅ Finds products starting with ‘S’.

9. Aggregate Functions

Perform calculations on data and return a single result.

Function	Description
COUNT()	Counts rows
SUM()	Adds up numeric values
AVG()	Calculates average
MIN()	Finds minimum
MAX()	Finds maximum

Example:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM orders;

10. GROUP BY and HAVING

Groups rows that have the same values and applies aggregate functions.

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;


✅ Departments having more than 5 employees.

11. JOIN Operations

Used to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.

Join Type	Description
INNER JOIN	Returns rows that have matching values in both tables
LEFT JOIN	Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right
RIGHT JOIN	Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left
FULL JOIN	Returns all records when there is a match in either table

Example:

SELECT orders.order_id, customers.name
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers
ON orders.customer_id = customers.id;

12. Subqueries

A query inside another query.

SELECT name
FROM students
WHERE marks > (SELECT AVG(marks) FROM students);


✅ Finds students scoring above average marks.

13. UNION and UNION ALL

Combine results from multiple queries.

SELECT city FROM customers_india
UNION
SELECT city FROM customers_usa;


✅ Combines both queries and removes duplicates.

14. ALTER, UPDATE, DELETE

Although not part of SELECT, these are essential DML operations.

-- Update
UPDATE employees SET salary = 60000 WHERE id = 3;

-- Delete
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 10;

📊 Example Practice Query
SELECT author_id
FROM views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
GROUP BY author_id;


✅ Returns distinct authors who viewed their own articles (from LeetCode Q1148 — Article Views I).
